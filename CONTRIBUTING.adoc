= Contribution Guidelines


== Adding to this list

This awesome list contains two views: standard github page view, and nice website with search.
You can contribute in this list in few ways:

1. Create issue with you link. - easiest way, if you doesn't have a lot time or you can't install node.js for some reason.
2. Edit ./app/Kotlin.js directly, and then run `npm install` and `npm run readme`. - For regular users of node.js.

I really appreciate any of this ways, so please feel free to create issues,
instead of spending time figuring out of how to install node.js for example.

Any links will be check for their value for Kotlin.

*Happy contributing!*
