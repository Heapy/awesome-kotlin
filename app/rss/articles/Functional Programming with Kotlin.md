The recording of our October 22nd webinar, **Functional Programming with Kotlin**, is now available on [JetBrainsTV YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/AhA-Q7MOre0).

In this talk, Mike Hearn provides a brief introduction to programming in Kotlin via practical example: creating a textfield with the autocomplete suggestions while typing. Demo project is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/mikehearn/KotlinFPWebinar).

Topics covered include:

*   Use of functional transforms
*   Immutability
*   Lazyness and working with lazy infinite sequences
*   The use of [funKTionale](https://github.com/MarioAriasC/funKTionale), a library that extends Kotlin with a few features known from Haskell
*   Pattern matching
*   Reactive user interfaces
