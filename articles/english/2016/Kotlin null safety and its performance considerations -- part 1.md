[Kotlin](http://kotlinlang.org) may seem like a new kid on the block – itʼs been officially released only in [February](http://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2016/02/kotlin-1-0-released-pragmatic-language-for-jvm-and-android/). Its history however dates [a few years back](http://www.infoworld.com/article/2622405/java/jetbrains-readies-jvm-based-language.html) and itʼs mature and stable enough to be used for developing solid reliable applications. Therefore at [Allegro](http://allegro.pl) we decided to give it a chance – we built our new shiny server-side system using Kotlin as its primary language and we do not regret it.

One of the first features a Kotlin developer learns is the languageʼs approach to handling `null` values. It is quite interesting – especially at times like these when the most popular way of handling this problem is to use some kind of [Option monad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_type). As weʼll soon see Kotlin actually does not introduce any new special wrapper type – it uses regular Java types albeit with slight variance.

## Null-safe world

In Kotlin when you declare a variable, a field or a function parameter, by default they cannot be `null`. For example letʼs suppose we have a class `Greeter` which has a function `hello` that by default prints a greeting message on the standard output:

```kotlin
class Greeter {
  fun hello(who: String): Unit {
    println ("Hello $who")
  }
}
```

We declared `who` to be of type `String` which is interpreted by the compiler to mean that `who` cannot be `null`. If we want to declare a _nullable_ parameter we have to add a question mark at the end of the type name:

```kotlin
class Greeter {
  fun hello(who: String?): Unit {
    println ("Hello $who")
  }
}
```

This simple solution turns out to be very convenient and strong at the same time. It divides the world of our code into two areas: one where `null`s are allowed and one where they arenʼt. As weʼll see in a moment Kotlin provides quite a range of helpful features which makes the transition between those areas entirely safe. Yet we have to be aware of a few surprising issues.

To fully explore how Kotlin handles `null`s underneath weʼll take a closer look at the code generated by Kotlin compiler. Weʼll do it on two levels: first weʼll inspect the output bytecode – although for brevity weʼll actually see equivalent Java code. Then, in the second part of this article – for some interesting cases weʼll have a glance at the machine code generated by [JVM JIT compiler](http://openjdk.java.net/groups/hotspot/docs/HotSpotGlossary.html#JITCompilers).

### Smart casts

Since Kotlin compiler knows the type of every variable, field, function parameter, etc. it can check if an incorrect assignment takes place and throw an error in such case. In the code below we try to assign a _nullable_ reference to a _non-null_ property:

```kotlin
class User {
  private var username: String = ""

  fun setName(newName: String?) {
    username = newName // the compiler will indicate an error here
  }
}
```

What if we wanted to check if the reference is not `null` and only then assign it to a property? The following code provides an answer:

```kotlin
class User {
  private var username: String = ""

  fun setName(newName: String?) {
    if (newName == null)
      throw NullPointerException("Name cannot be null!")

    username = newName // here the compiler knows that newName cannot be null and therefore
  }                    // its type is String and not String?
}
```

This construct – where the compiler can infer that the reference cannot be `null` – is called smart casting as it seems to cast the reference from `String?` to `String`.

There is one thing we have to bear in mind when using smart casts. We can only do it with references that cannot be changed between the checkpoint and the actual assignment. In the code above the reference was taken from the function parameter which cannot change in the course of function execution. If we were to take the reference from some read/write property the compiler would not allow it:

```kotlin
class UserRequest {
  var username: String? = null
}

class User {
  private var username: String = ""

  fun setNameFrom(request: UserRequest) {
    if (request.username == null)
      throw NullPointerException("Name cannot be null!")

    username = request.username // here the compiler cannot be sure that request.username
  }                             // is not null - it could change in some other thread
}                               // right after the condition check
```

### The !! operator

The code shown in the above example looks quite common. When we expect a reference to be not `null` and this assumption proves wrong we may want to throw `NullPointerException`. Kotlin has a special syntax for such cases:

```kotlin
class User {
  private var username: String = ""

  fun setName(newName: String?) {
    username = newName!! // the type of newName!! is String and the compiler generates a runtime check to be sure of that...
  }
}
```

The equivalent Java code as taken from the bytecode generated by the Kotlin compiler is as follows:

```kotlin
import org.jetbrains.annotations.Nullable;

import static kotlin.jvm.internal.Intrinsics.throwNpe;

public final class User {
  private String username = "";

  public void setName(@Nullable newName: String) {
    if (newName == null) {
      throwNpe();
    }

    username = newName;
  }
}
```

We can see a couple of interesting things here:

1.  The `newName` parameter of the `setName` method gets an annotation indicating its _nullability_. This annotation is used internally by Kotlin compiler and [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), although one can think of using it also in tools like [FindBugs](http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/) or [Checker Framework](http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/current/checker-framework-manual.html#nullness-checker).
2.  The code in `setName` has a striking resemblance (surprise!) to the code we wrote in our smart cast example. The only difference is the usage of the `throwNpe` method. Weʼll delve into the details in part 2 – for now we can make a simplification and state that it throws `KotlinNullPointerException` (which extends `NullPointerException`).

### Parameter validation

So far in our examples we didnʼt have methods which were not private and at the same time had non-`null` parameters. In order to gain some insight into what happens in such situations letʼs modify our code:

```kotlin
class User {
  var username: String = ""

  fun setName(newName: String) {
    username = newName
  }
}
```

One obvious method that weʼd like to have a look at is the `setName` method. But the equivalent Java code contains a surprise:

```java
import org.jetbrains.annotations.NotNull;
import org.jetbrains.annotations.Nullable;

import static kotlin.jvm.internal.Intrinsics.checkParameterIsNotNull;

public class User {
  @NotNull
  private String username = "";

  @NotNull
  public String getUsername() {
    return username;
  }

  public void setUsername(@NotNull String value) {
    checkParameterIsNotNull(value, "<set-?>");

    username = value;
  }

  public void setName(@NotNull String newName) {
    checkParameterIsNotNull(value, "newName");

    username = value;
  }
}
```

We can see that we now have two additional methods (`getUsername` and `setUsername`) and the `username` field earned a `@NotNull` annotation. Weʼre witnesses to how Kotlin compiler manages properties in classes:

1.  If it is `private` then a property is simply a field of the class with no special annotations – this is because this property is not visible anywhere outside the class and therefore Kotlin compiler can optimize access to it and it can be sure that the field will always be non-`null`.
2.  If it is not `private` then a property is actually a field with a pair of setter and getter methods – this is because the property is visible to the outside world and Kotlin compiler must check upon every access that it is non-`null` and at the same time provide this information to this outside world.

We can also observe that to check whether a value of a parameter is not `null` the `checkParameterIsNotNull` method is used. Again weʼll investigate this method in part 2. For now it is enough to say that upon receiving a `null` value an `IllegalArgumentException` will be thrown.

### Elvis operator

When we have a `null` value there are situations when instead of throwing an exception weʼd rather do something else. We can compare this to a `default` block in Java `switch` statement. A simple `if` statement with an `else` should suffice here, but Kotlin has a special syntax for it – the famous [Elvis operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_operator).

Letʼs suppose that for a `null` value weʼd like to set `username` to `"N/A"`:

```kotlin
class User {
  private var username: String = ""

  fun setName(newName: String?) {
    username = newName ?: "N/A"
  }
}
```

The equivalent Java code is:


```java
import org.jetbrains.annotations.Nullable;

public class User {
  private String username = "";

  public void setName(@Nullable String newName) {
    username = (newName != null) ? newName : "N/A";
  }
}
```


The Kotlin syntax is more concise and itʼs also worth mentioning that the expression after the Elvis operator is lazily evaluated and it can also throw an exception. So itʼs completely legal to have this kind of code:

```kotlin
class User {
  private var username: String = ""

  fun setName(newName: String?) {
    username = newName ?: throw RuntimeException("Are you nuts?")
  }
}
```

The equivalent Java code is:


```java
import org.jetbrains.annotations.Nullable;

public class User {
  private String username = "";

  public void setName(@Nullable String newName) {
    if (newName != null)
      username = newName;
    else
      throw new RuntimeException("Are you nuts?");
  }
}
```

### Safe calls and let/run/apply functions

There are circumstances when we have a possibly `null` object and we want to invoke a method on it but only if it is actually non-`null` (because otherwise we would get `NullPointerException`). We can do it with simple `if`, but Kotlin provides a fancy `?.` operator to make the code more compact. So this code:

```kotlin
data class SimpleUser(var name: String)

object Users {
  private val userMap = mapOf(1 to SimpleUser("John"))

  @JvmStatic
  fun getUser(userId: Int): SimpleUser? = userMap[userId]
}

fun getUserName(userId: Int): String? =
        getUser (userId)?.name
```

has the following equivalent Java code for `getUserName`:


```java
@Nullable
public String getUserName(int userId) {
  SimpleUser simpleUser = getUser(userId);
  return simpleUser != null ? simpleUser.getName() : null;
}
```

Kotlin code is indeed a lot shorter and more expressive. To further aid developers Kotlin provides three convenient [higher-order functions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/lambdas.html#higher-order-functions): `let`, `run` and `apply`. Although they are not directly related to `null`-safety issues we often use them with potentially `null` objects. Below you can find some code examples – they should give you an intuition about when and how to use them.

#### let

Letʼs look at the following code with [`let`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/let.html) (pardon the pun):

```kotlin
fun findUserNameWithLet(userId: Int): String? =
    getUser (userId)?.let { it.name }
```

`let` is essentially an [extension function](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/extensions.html#extension-functions) (i.e. a method of a class which you can define outside of the class definition) that can be invoked on any type. It takes a [lambda expression](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/lambdas.html#lambda-expressions-and-anonymous-functions) as its parameter and calls the expression with `this` as an argument. If a _lambda expression_ has only one parameter then we may skip declaring it and simply access the parameter via the name... `it`. Therefore in the example above `this` inside the lambda (`this` is of type `SimpleUser` – the type returned by the `getUser` method) is accessible as `it`. The value of the _lambda expression_ is returned as the result of the `let` function.

The equivalent Java code for `findUserNameWithLet` is as follows:

```java
@Nullable
public String findUserNameWithLet(int userId) {
  String result;

  SimpleUser simpleUser = getUser(userId);
  if (simpleUser != null) {
    SimpleUser it = simpleUser;

    result = it.getName(); // { it.name }
  } else {
    result = null;
  }

  return result;
}
```

`let` is usually used if we want to perform some operations on a non-`null` object and return the result of these operations while simply returning `null` for `null` objects.

#### run

The [`run`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/run.html) function is a slight variation of `let`. It takes a parameterless _lambda expression_ as its parameter and the object on which you invoke `run` can be accessed via `this` inside the _lambda expression_. Just like in `let` the result of the _lambda expression_ is returned as the result of the `run` function.

Letʼs see an example:

```kotlin
fun findUserNameWithRun(userId: Int): String? =
    getUser (userId)?.run { name }
```

and the equivalent Java code:

```kotlin
@Nullable
public String findUserNameWithRun(int userId) {
  String result;

  SimpleUser simpleUser = getUser(userId);
  if (simpleUser != null) {
    SimpleUser $receiver = simpleUser;

    result = $receiver.getName(); // { name }
  } else {
    result = null;
  }

  return result;
}
```

As we can see there is little difference with `let` – Kotlin code is similar although with `run` it is even more concise.

#### apply

The last of the three convenient functions weʼre going to talk about is [`apply`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/apply.html). The following code illustrates its usage:

```kotlin
fun findUserNameWithApply(userId: Int): SimpleUser? =
      getUser (userId)?.apply { name = "Jane" }
}
```

`apply` is similar to `run` – it is an _extension function_ which takes a parameterless _lambda expression_ as its parameter and the object on which you invoke `apply` can be accessed via `this` inside the _lambda expression_. However, the return value of `apply` is the object on which you invoke it (and not the _lambda expression_ result).

The equivalent Java code for `findUserNameWithApply` is as follows:

```java
@Nullable
public SimpleUser findUserNameWithApply(int userId) {
  SimpleUser result;

  SimpleUser simpleUser = getUser(userId);
  if (simpleUser != null) {
    SimpleUser $receiver = simpleUser;

    $receiver.setName("Jane"); // { name = "Jane" }

    result = simpleUser;
  } else {
    result = null;
  }

  return result;
}
```

The most common reason to use `apply` is the initialisation of an object. If there is something we have to do before returning an object (and simply return `null` if it is `null`) then `apply` is the way to go.

### Platform types

So far we have not talked about the interoperability with Java. While from Java code point of view with regard to `null`-safety nothing unusual happens if we call Kotlin code, there is a difference when we want to call Java code from Kotlin. This is especially important for the case of the result returned from Java method where Kotlin compiler has to take some precautions. After all it does not know if the value returned can be `null` or not.

To resolve this problem Kotlin introduces the concept of [platform types](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/java-interop.html#null-safety-and-platform-types). In essence _platform type_ is used every time Kotlin compiler encounters an invocation of Java method which was not generated by Kotlin compiler. At the same time a developer cannot explicitly declare anything to be of _platform type_ – it exists solely when Kotlin compiler infers it from the code.

Letʼs look at some code samples which present most of things you have to know about _platform types_:

```kotlin
fun writeOutNullable(s: String?) = println(s)

fun nullableCase() {
  val value = System.getProperty("key") // value has a platform type String!
  writeOutNullable(value)               // The ! after a type indicates it's a platform type
}
```

The equivalent Java code is:

```java
public void nullableCase() {
  String value = System.getProperty("key");
  writeOutNullable(value);
}
```

We can see nothing special here – the _platform type_ is taken as is when it is converted to a _nullable_ type.

Letʼs see what happens when the target type is non-`null`:

```kotlin
fun writeOut(s: String) {
  println(s)
}

fun nonNullCase() {
  val value = System.getProperty("key") // value has a platform type String!

  writeOut(value)
}
```

The equivalent Java code is:

```java
import static kotlin.jvm.internal.Intrinsics.checkExpressionValueIsNotNull;

public void nonNullCase() {
  String value = System.getProperty("key");

  checkExpressionValueIsNotNull(value, "value");
  writeOut(value);
}
```

Now we have a validation in the generated code. `writeOut` expects a non-`null` type, but the `value` type is _platform type_ and in theory it could be `null`. Therefore the compiler produces a runtime check with the help of `checkExpressionValueIsNotNull` method which weʼll explore in part 2.

Next example shows the code where only Java methods are used.

```kotlin
fun pureJavaCase() {
  val value = System.getProperty("key") // value has a platform type String!

  System.setProperty("other_key", value)
}
```

The equivalent Java code is:

```java
public void pureJavaCase() {
  String value = System.getProperty("key");

  System.setProperty("other_key", value);
}
```

Just like when we had the _nullable_ types no runtime check is generated. After all at no place in the code do we pass the value to the code which explicitly expects non-`null` values.

One might ask what happens after the value is checked not to be `null` – does the compiler treat it as a non-`null` value?

```kotlin
fun doubleCheckCase() {
  val value = System.getProperty("key") // value has a platform type String!

  writeOut(value)
  writeOut(value)
}
```

The equivalent Java code is:

```java
public void doubleCheckCase() {
  String value = System.getProperty("key");

  checkExpressionValueIsNotNull(value, "value");
  writeOut(value);
  checkExpressionValueIsNotNull(value, "value");
  writeOut(value);
}
```

It appears it doesnʼt – the runtime checks are generated each time the conversion to non-`null` type takes place.

The following example shows assigning the value with _platform type_ to some variable without explicitly stating this variable type:

```kotlin
fun assignCase() {
  val value = System.getProperty("key") // value has a platform type String!
  val newValue = value // newValue has a platform type String!

  writeOut(newValue)
}
```

The equivalent Java code is:

```java
public void assignCase() {
  String value = System.getProperty("key");
  String newValue = value;

  checkExpressionValueIsNotNull(newValue, "newValue");
  writeOut(newValue);
}
```

No surprise here – the type of the variable `newValue` is also a _platform type_ and runtime checks are generated.

What if we explicitly state the variableʼs type?

```kotlin
fun explicitCase() {
  val value = System.getProperty("key") // value has a platform type String!

  val nullableValue: String? = value
  writeOutNullable(nullableValue)

  val nonNullValue: String = value
  writeOut(nonNullValue)
  writeOut(nonNullValue)
}
```

The equivalent Java code is:

```java
public void explicitCase() {
  String value = System.getProperty("key");

  String nullableValue = value;
  writeOutNullable(nullableValue);

  checkExpressionValueIsNotNull(value)
  String nonNullValue = value;
  writeOut(nonNullValue);
  writeOut(nonNullValue);
}
```

As we can see the rule is simple – every time we go from the _plaform type_ to non-`null` type a runtime check is generated. Once weʼre in the `null`-safe world no additional validation is needed.

In the examples above weʼve seen that the `checkExpressionValueIsNotNull` method takes a variable name as the second parameter. This is done so that when a `null` value is passed youʼll see an error message with the name of the variable in it. But as the name of the method implies the second parameter does not have to be a variable name. In fact itʼs always an expression name, but in the cases presented above we had simple one-variable expressions. If we had a more complicated expression...:

```kotlin
fun funnyCase() {
  writeOut(System.getProperty("key"))
}
```

The equivalent Java code is:

```java
public void funnyCase() {
  String tmp = System.getProperty("key");
  checkExpressionValueIsNotNull(tmp, "System.getProperty(\"key\")");
  writeOut(tmp);
}
```

If we now call `funnyCase` (and there is no `"key"` system property set) then weʼll see the following stack trace:

```
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalStateException: System.getProperty("key") must not be null
    at pl.kk.test.kotlin.PlatformTypesKt.funnyCase(PlatformTypes.kt:54)
    at pl.kk.test.kotlin.FunnyCaseCall.main(PlatformTypes.kt:60)
```

### Summary

Weʼve taken a tour of different Kotlin language constructs where you could observe the code generated by the compiler. During regular development you rarely have to think about how things work under the hood. Nonetheless it is useful to know a thing or two about it. And if youʼre interested in the performance issues surrounding some of those constructs check out the second part of this article which will be soon published.
