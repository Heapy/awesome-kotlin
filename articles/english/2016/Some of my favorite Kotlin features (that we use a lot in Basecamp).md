Team Android at Basecamp recently passed a fairly big milestone‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääover 25% of the [Basecamp 3 Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.basecamp.bc3) code base now runs on Kotlin! üéâ

_Github statistics for the Basecamp 3 Android app as of 5/27/16._

We‚Äôve found that Kotlin not only makes our code much better, but massively [increases programmer happiness](https://m.signalvnoise.com/how-i-fell-in-love-with-a-programming-language-8933d5e749ed). All of this ensures we‚Äôre making the best app we can for the tens of thousands of Android users we support.

Given our new experiences with the language, I thought it‚Äôd be worth sharing some specifics that make the language so wonderful to work with.

Unlike most articles that introduce you to a language, I‚Äôm going to avoid using too much programming lingo. Instead, I‚Äôll try using plain English in the hopes that it‚Äôs more accessible to beginners. **ü§ó**

**Some notes about the code examples:**

* I am by no stretch an expert in Kotlin. Read, consider, and discuss!
* They look better on a desktop browser**.** You can get by on the mobile app in landscape mode, but I‚Äôd recommend breaking out your laptop to read them.
* They‚Äôre brief and simple on purpose**.** Long-winded examples tend to cause confusion. Take these simple examples and extrapolate them into your own potential uses, and you‚Äôll see a lot more power.

Let‚Äôs get started with seven of my current favorites!

#### 1. Replacing simple if/else if/else blocks with when

One of my absolute favorites.

```java
// Java  
if (firstName.equals("Dan")) {  
    person.setTeam(programmers);  
} else if (lastName.equals("Dihiansan")) {  
    person.setTeam(designers);  
} else {  
    person.setTeam(others);  
}
```

```kotlin
// Kotlin  
when {  
    firstName == "Dan"       -> person.team = programmers  
    lastName  == "Dihiansan" -> person.team = designers  
    else                     -> person.team = others  
}
```

_when_ blocks are effectively the same as a simple _if_ block, but look how much more readable that is!

There‚Äôs a similar convention when only one argument is being checked. Typically this would be a long, ugly switch/case statement in Java.

```java
// Java  
switch (firstName) {  
    case "Dan": person.setTeam(programmers)  
        break;  
    case "Jay": person.setTeam(programmers)  
        break;  
    case "Jamie": person.setTeam(designers)  
        break;  
    default:  
        person.setTeam(others)  
}
```

```kotlin
// Kotlin  
when (firstName) {  
    "Dan", "Jay" -> person.team = programmers  
    "Jamie"      -> person.team = designers  
    else         -> person.team = others  
}
```

I swear, this alone is worth writing Kotlin.

#### 2. Beautifying even the ugliest click handlers

Using [Anko](https://github.com/Kotlin/anko), a library built for Kotlin, click listeners are ridiculously easy.

I hate writing these in Java so much that I could barely bring myself to write an example here. But I soldiered on. üò≠

```java
// Java  
view.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {  
    @Override  
    public void onClick(View v) {  
        System.out.println("This is horrible");  
    }  
});
```

```kotlin
// Kotlin  
view._onClick_ {  
    println("WAT")  
}
```

#### 3. No more view binding

By using the [Kotlin Android Extensions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/android-plugin.html), you no longer need to bind views to objects to start working with them. You can access them directly without any binding. Zero. None.

```java
// Java  
EditText composer = findViewById(R.id.composer);  
composer.setText("Allo!");
```

```kotlin
// Kotlin   
view.composer.text = "Allo!"
```

That might not look like a big deal in isolation, but think about how much of your Activity/Controller code is the ceremony of binding a view to an object before you can start to work with that object. Kotlin bypasses all of that.

#### **4. Functions in one line**

One line functions can technically be written in Java, but you‚Äôd be going against generally accepted styles.

Kotlin‚Äôs inherent brevity makes one-liners (officially called [single-expression functions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/functions.html#single-expression-functions)) quite common, and they look great. No extra lines and no braces required.

```java
// Java  
public String fullName() {  
    return getFirstName() + " " + getLastName();  
}
```

```kotlin
// Kotlin  
fun fullName() = "${firstName} ${lastName}"
```

**Bonus**: the return object type is implied, so Kotlin will automatically know the method is returning a String without ever having to write ‚ÄúString‚Äù anywhere.

You may have also noticed in this example 1) [no need for _public_](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/visibility-modifiers.html)and 2) [string interpolation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/idioms.html#string-interpolation).

#### 5. Convenience methods built on top of familiar objects

Kotlin has extended objects you‚Äôre familiar with and made them even better and packaged them into the [Kotlin Standard Library](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/).

Take String comparisons for example:

```java
// Java  
if (name.toLowerCase().contains(firstName.toLowerCase())) {  
    ...  
}
```

```kotlin
// Kotlin  
if (name.contains(firstName, true)) { ... }
```

Not a huge difference, but enough to improve readability in many places. The standard library has tons of these kinds of tweaks. Perfect!

#### 6. Reducing the need for `if (whatever != null)`

Null checking is so painfully common in Java that `if (whatever != null)` is probably in your recurring nightmares.

Kotlin has a number of [impressive null safety](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/null-safety.html) features built in, and _let_ is just one of those ways to achieve more readable code.

```java
// Java  
if (message != null) {  
    System.out.println(message)  
}
```

```kotlin
// Kotlin  
message?.let { println(it) }
```

Here if _message_ is not null, Kotlin will _let_ the block (what‚Äôs inside the braces) run. If it‚Äôs null, it just skips it.

There‚Äôs one other bit of awesomeness‚Ää‚Äî‚Äänotice the _println(it)_ statement? The _it_ keyword allows you to reference the object the _let_ began from.

#### 7. The Elvis operator

I mostly love this operator because of its name. It looks like this:

```kotlin
?: // Turn your head to the left, you may see someone familiar
```

Fun name aside, the real reason this is great is because it handles the common scenario of ‚Äúif something is null, I want to give it a value, but otherwise just leave it alone‚Äù.

```java
// Java  
if (people == null) {  
    people = new ArrayList();  
}  
return people;
```

```kotlin
// Kotlin  
return people ?: emptyArrayList()
```

Here if _people_ isn‚Äôt null, it returns. If it is, it returns whatever is to the right of the Elvis operator.

So that‚Äôs just a brief look at some things that make my life better every day working with Kotlin.

If you‚Äôre interested in getting started with Kotlin, their [documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/) is _very_ good, and you can poke around the interactive [Kotlin Koans](http://try.kotlinlang.org/#/Kotlin%20Koans/Introduction/Hello,%20world!/Task.kt). I tend to struggle with things like koans (feels too much like school work!), so if you‚Äôre like me, I‚Äôd encourage you to [try building something real](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/kotlin-android.html).
