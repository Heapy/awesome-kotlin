The Kotlin 1.1 release was warmly met by the community. To demonstrate the new features in Kotlin 1.1, JetBrains offered an online event. All those interested were able to watch a live stream of Andrey Breslav’s demo presentation and get their questions answered during a Q&A session.

This motivated many local communities to meet up: more than 30 user groups hosted events in 21 countries.

You can find the full list of the events at [the Kotlin community web page][]. Over 3000 people joined the broadcast on the day of the event.

The recording of the demo presentation and the Q&A is available on YouTube:

## Kotlin 1.1 Event Feedback ##

If you watched the live stream, we want to know what you think! Please share your feedback by [completing this form][]. It should only take about 7-10 minutes. Your input is very important in helping us improve all future Kotlin events.

## Kotlin Future Features Survey ##

![future\_features\_collage\_2][future_features_collage_2]
We also offered all communities to make an impact on Kotlin future. Event organizers received survey kits and event participants could have a say on the most expected features in an off-line mode. The survey gained much attention, and we’ve now placed it online to listen to the wider community. Now you can [have your say on the Kotlin future][] online!

Please note it’s more likely that you won’t see those features in v1.2, but we will take your opinion into account when prioritizing our work.
