# Contribution Help

## Adding to this list

This awesome list contains two views: standard github README page view, and nice website with search.

**To contribute** to both places you need:

Edit **[src/main/resources/links/](./src/main/resources/links/)file_name.kts** directly, and then run `./gradlew run`.

Please check diff, and make sure that your PR contains minimal set of changes.

*Happy contributing!*

## How to update webpage?

Build on Travis CI automatically updates webpage on pushes to master.
